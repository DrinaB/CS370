# CS370

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was given starter code that set up the environment, defined states and actions, and structured the reward system. I created the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent, including building the neural network model, implementing the experience replay buffer, defining the epsilon-greedy exploration strategy, tuning hyperparameters, and coding the target network update logic to stabilize training.


### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, develop, and optimize systems and algorithms to solve real-world problems. Their work impacts nearly every industry, driving innovation, improving accessibility, and automating tasks to make processes more efficient and reliable. In this project, I experienced how designing intelligent systems can replicate and enhance human decision-making.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems by analyzing the requirements, breaking the problem into smaller components, researching possible solutions, implementing the best-suited algorithm, and refining it through testing and iteration. In this project, I modeled the agentâ€™s behavior after human problem-solving in mazes and used reinforcement learning to build and train a solution.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the solutions I create are safe, transparent, reliable, and fair to users. Intelligent systems must behave predictably, and any limitations should be clearly communicated. I also have a duty to respect user privacy, minimize bias, and uphold the values and integrity of the organization I represent.
